# This file is a template for PSF fitting.
# Complete all fields A to F.
#
# For field B, newline is "\n" and accepted delimiters are " ", "," and "\t"
# (space, comma, tab).
#
# For field E, enter the fraction of the integrated radius at which Gaussian
# fitting will take place.
#
# Select isolated stars with no other sources in the vicinity, otherwise
# the stacking might become biased.
#
# Massey and Davis suggest the following pairs of values for fitting radius
# and PSF radius respectively: (3, 11) or (4, 13).


## Input map file. Enter path to input image:
A) ../img/HATLASJ091331-003644_final_drz_sci.fits

## Input star list coordinates file. Each star in new row, in (x,y) order:
B) starlist.txt

## Output PSF image filename. If default "NONE":
C) NONE

## Size of rectangle where guess centroid is drawn. Default is 4.0 arcsec:
D) 4.0

## Size of rectangle where Gaussian is fitted. Defalut is 7 px:
# NOTE: This has to do with pixscale, could change it to angle.
D) 7

## Pixel saturation value. If not known "NONE":
F) NONE

# end
