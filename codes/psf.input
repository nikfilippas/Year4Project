# This file is a template for PSF fitting.
# Complete all fields A to G.
#
# For field B, newline is "\n" and accepted delimiters are " ", "," and "\t"
# (space, comma, tab).
#
# For field E, enter the fraction of the integrated radius at which Gaussian
# fitting will take place.
#
# Massey and Davis suggest the following pairs of values for fitting radius
# and PSF radius respectively: (3, 11) or (4, 13).
#
# Select isolated stars with no other sources in the vicinity, otherwise
# the stacking might become biased.


## Input map file. Enter path to input image:
A) ../img/HATLASJ091331-003644_final_drz_sci.fits

## Input star list coordinates file. Each star in new row, in (x,y) order:
B) starlist.txt

## Output PSF image filename. If default "NONE":
C) NONE

## Output noisemap image filename. If default "NONE":
D) NONE

## Gaussian fitting radius in SD units. Default is 3.0:
E) 3.0

## Maximum PSF radius in FWHM units. Default is 11.0:
F) 11.0

## Pixel saturation value. If not known "NONE":
G) NONE
